## Author: Philip Amwata

### Project Description
Machine Learning (Unsupervised Learning - Clustering).
Dimensionality Reduction method - Principal Component Analysis.
From a data set containing 64 pairs of values, program
computes the covariance matrix and identifies 2 Principal Components.
The program also computes the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors associated
with the Principal Components as well as the Total variance,
showcasing the proportion as a percentage that the 2 Principal Components explain.

### Project Structure
**bin**: The output executables go here, both for the app and for any tests and spikes.
**build**: This folder contains all object files, and is removed on a clean.
**include**: All project header files. All necessary third-party header files that do not exist under /usr/local/include.
**lib**: Any libs that get compiled by the project, third party or any needed in development.
**src**: The applicationâ€™s source files.
**test**: All test code files.
