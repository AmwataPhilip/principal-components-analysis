# principal-components-analysis
Machine Learning (Unsupervised Learning - Clustering). From a data set containing 64 pairs of values, program computes the covariance matrix and identifies 2 Principal Components. The program also computes the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors associated with the Principal Components as well as the Total variance, showcasing the proportion as a percentage that the 2 Principal Components explain.
